# Newsletter-Signup
-> This is coded in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, NodeJs and Express

-> This project uses mailchimp API

-> If it is a success (i.e., you have successfully subscribed to our newsletter) then it will redirect you to the Success Page
    otherwise it will redirect you to the failure page


# Important
-> Node Modules are not included, So to use the code you have to install bodey-parser, express and request npm modules to set up the environment
